# C_HESS

## Summary
C_HESS is a project where I'm trying to make a playable chess game in the terminal (only Unix for now, but maybe i'll add windows support later).

## How to play
You play the two players (maybe i'll add computer player later). On each turn, you'll have to input a start position and and end position. If your starting position is empty, you'll be asked again. If your end point is not correct, you'll be asked again too.
